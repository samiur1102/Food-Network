            <h2>BREAKFAST</h2>
            <p>An ideal breakfast should contain enough healthy calories to be burned in our entire day.
                You can go for some breads, milk and cereals. Try to take one or two whole eggs. Drink enough water
                to keep yourself hydrated. Make sure to take your breakfast early in the morning.

            <h2>LUNCH</h2>
            <p>An ideal lunch should contain a balance between nutrients, vitamins and minerals. Don't eat too heavy.
                Try to take some meats with enough green vegetables. Trust me, these vegetables
                will keep you refreshed. You can add some coffee or tea to get rid off your afternoon laziness.

            <h2>DINNER</h2>
            <p>An ideal dinner should be very precise. You won't get enough time to burn your intake, so you
                must keep your dinner short. Try to take some fruits, vegetables and sufficient water before
                you go to bed. Your dinner should be done at least two hours prior to your sleeptime.
